# React Native Application

This repository contains a React Native application that can be built and run on both Android and iOS devices. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

- Node.js (version 12 or later)
- npm (Node package manager)
- JDK (Java Development Kit) for Android development
- Android Studio for Android development
- Xcode for iOS development (Mac only)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:kareem-adel/browser.git
```

2. Navigate to the project's root directory:

```shell
cd browser
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

## Running on Android

To run the application on an Android device or emulator, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have an Android device connected to your computer or an Android emulator set up.

2. Start the Metro bundler, which will bundle and serve the JavaScript code:

```shell
npx react-native start
```

3. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the project's root directory.

4. Build and install the app on your Android device or emulator:

```shell
npx react-native run-android
```

This will build the app and automatically install it on the connected Android device or emulator. The app should launch automatically.

## Running on iOS

To run the application on an iOS device or simulator, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Xcode installed on your Mac.

2. Start the Metro bundler, which will bundle and serve the JavaScript code:

```shell
npx react-native start
```

3. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the project's root directory.

4. Build and install the app on your iOS device or simulator:

```shell
npx react-native run-ios
```

This will build the app and automatically install it on the connected iOS device or launch it in the iOS simulator.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any build errors or issues, make sure you have followed the installation instructions correctly and have all the necessary dependencies installed.

- If you're having trouble with the Android build, try opening the project in Android Studio and syncing the Gradle files. Make sure you have the correct Android SDK version installed.

- If you're having trouble with the iOS build, try cleaning the Xcode project and rebuilding it. Make sure you have the necessary provisioning profiles and certificates configured in Xcode.
